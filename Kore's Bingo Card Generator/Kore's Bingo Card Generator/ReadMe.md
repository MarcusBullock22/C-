This is a bingo card counter I made for my wife. When ran, it will calculate random numbers based on the amount of bingo cards someone would want.
it then stores all given card numbers in a text file so that they are no longer used throughout the night. Whenever you want to reset for the day, or later on, 
there is a reset button to delete the list
